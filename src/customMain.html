              <p><br>Accounts receivable factoring is a process that turns your accounts receivables into capital by
                eliminating the waiting period while your invoices are paid. This process work only for businesses with
                a business-to-business (B2B) or a business-to-government (B2G) model. <br><br>
                This provides businesses with the opportunity to have consistent cash flow for ongoing operations and
                additional cash reserves to fund growth opportunities. For many businesses, maintaining enough cash can
                be difficult, especially if a business is young or experiencing rapid growth. <br><br>
                Factor-X provides help to these businesses through AR factoring and we can use this
                process to assess your client's ability to pay (not your ability).
